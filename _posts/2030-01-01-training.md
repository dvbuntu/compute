On Site Training
---

Hopefully you've found this guide helpful in improving your computing workflow.  But I know that sometimes you can learn much more easily face-to-face.  Conveniently, I also like teaching face-to-face, we should totally hang out!

I offer formal training for interactive computing workflows.  This can be a simple 1-day guided tour for your graduate department, a weeklong workshop getting a division trained, or even an ongoing support contract to help you through unusual situations.  If you're interested, please email me, Dan Van Boxel (<mailto:the.dvb@gmail.com>), to discuss scheduling and pricing.  When possible, I try to offer discounted or at-cost rates to academic departments and non-profits. 

Customized Workflows
---

Sometimes, the work you do may require adjustments or additions to this basic workflow to really shine.  I understand the need for flexibility, and I'd like to help develop an adapted workflow for your computational needs.  With a proper thoughtful workflow, your people can productively focus on the creative instead of the tedious.  As above, email Dan Van Boxel (<mailto:the.dvb@gmail.com>) for more information.

Prebuilt Software

N.B. Work in progress, these may not be available yet.

While this workflow generally applies to Linux environments, I offer a variety of ways to access it.  First, I have an Arch Linux [metapackage](http://github.com/dvbuntu/compute-tools) that will install the necessary open source tools like `tmux`, `ipython`, etc.  If you don't yet have Linux, I also sell USB sticks preloaded with the distribution and the required packages.  This can be used as both a "live" distro that you just plug in and reboot into, or to install on a local computer.  Finally, sometimes you just need an existing server with these capabilities already.  I've contracted with a cloud provider to make virtual images.  And if you're looking for a customized workflow, I can provide that in the format most convenient for you.

I'm Dan Van Boxel (<mailto:the.dvb@gmail.com>), and good luck on your computing adventure!
