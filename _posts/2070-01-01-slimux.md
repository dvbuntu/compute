Slimux
---

`slimux` is the blood that gives life to this workflow.  It enables you to keep your focus on the creative problem.

[`slimux`](https://github.com/epeli/slimux) is a simple tool that connects `vim` to `tmux`.  `tmux` itself has a command-line flag to send an argument to a specified pane.  That is, it sends text directly from the command line to a pane.  In this way, one could issue shell commands from any terminal to a terminal under `tmux` on the local machine.

```bash
# Put the text "foo" in a buffer
tmux set-buffer foo 
# Send to Session 0, Window 1, Pane 2
tmux paste-buffer -t 0:1.2
```

`slimux` is really a `vim` wrapper around this command.  It binds a few keys to sending text from `vim` to a `tmux` pane.  Following `vim` syntax, you can send lines, a range of lines, or an arbitrary selection!

That's well and good, but this is particularly useful when our `vim` session is full of code or commands we've been writing, and our target `tmux` pane is running an interpreter of our preffered scripting language.  Suddenly, you have both superb text editing and a seamless REPL.  [An Optimal Workflow]({{ site.baseurl }}/{% post_url 2050-01-01-workflow %}).
