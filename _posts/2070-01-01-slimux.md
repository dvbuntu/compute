slimux

Slimux is the blood that gives life to this workflow.  It enables you to keep your focus on the creative problem.

Workflow Options

1. Pure Ipython
    + Focus is directly in REPL, "instant" feedback (this is huge)
    - Limited text editing support
    - Can save text, but only want "correct" lines (will have to edit later)
    - Lacks full terminal and associated shell programs
2. Vim + Ipython copy-paste
    + Powerful text editing for command construction
    + Simply save file when done
    - Mental distance between code and execution
        * Highlighting exactly takes time and focus
        * Digital mental task ("execute this code and show me results") becomes analog dexterity one

Suppose you've got a basic setup for data analysis with Ipython and vimi (and hopefully Tmux).  In the text editor, you compose your commands (enjoying more power and flexibility than in Ipython), and copy-paste away.  It works pretty well.  But every time, you have to copy paste, it distracts you from the data.  It doesn't seem like much at first, but it adds up.  But it's a toll you pay every time.  And it's a toll you don't have to pay.

Solution: Bridge the gap with Slimux.  Slimux allows you to send text, lines, or arbitrary selections from vim to a Tmux pane.  One or two keystrokes is all it takes; your fingers never leave the keyboard and your focus never leaves the problem.


`slimux` let's you send lines of code from `vim` to a `tmux` pane.  It's awesome!
