Compute
---

This is a guide to effective interactive computing, because we don't know how to use computers.  Specifically we're really bad at exploring data with computers.  This site will walk you through some of the problems with existing workflows, build up the tools for a new workflow, and finally engage in a smooth REPL.  Some highlights:

* Combine [ipython]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2090-01-01-ipython %}), [tmux]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2080-01-01-tmux %}), and [slimux]({{ site.baseurl }}{%post_url 2070-01-01-slimux %}) for interactive data exploration
* Improve your REPL.  Improve your computing effectiveness
* Make the computer compute; you do the fun stuff
* Explore [other]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2040-01-01-jupyter %}) REPLs.

Learn [why]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2099-01-01-motivation %}) your current setup is ineffective.
